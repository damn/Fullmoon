## How to start

You need to have [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed.

```
./dev
```

<details>
  <summary>Dev-loop contains:</summary>

* NREPL-Server
* On application close (ESC in the main menu), clojure.tools.namespace will do  refresh on any changed files and restart the app.
* On any error the JVM does not have to be restarted, you can fix the error and call `gdx.dev/restart!`
    * I have bound it on my VIM to F5 with: `nmap <F5> :Eval (do (in-ns 'gdx.dev)(restart!))`
